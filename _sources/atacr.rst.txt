Introduction
************

``atacr`` is a module for the correction of vertical component data from OBS
stations from tilt and compliance noise. This module is a translation of the 
Matlab code `ATaCR  <https://github.com/helenjanisz/ATaCR>`_ and the acronym 
stands for Automatic Tilt and Compliance Removal. For more details on the 
theory and methodology, we refer the interested reader to the following papers:

The analysis can be carried out for either one (or both) compliance or tilt
corrections. In all cases the analysis requires at least vertical component
data. Additional data required depend on the type of analysis. The software 
will automatically calculate all possible corrections depending on the available
channels. 

Noise Corrections
*****************

**Compliance**

Compliance is defined as the spectral ratio between pressure and vertical
displacement data. Compliance noise arises from seafloor deformation due
to seafloor and water wave effects (including infragravity waves). 
This is likely the main source of noise in vertical component OBS data. 
This analysis therefore requires both vertical (``?HZ``) and pressure (``?XH``) data.

**Tilt**

Tilt noise arises from OBS stations that are not perfectly leveled, and
therefore the horizontal seafloor deformation leaks onto the vertical
component. This effect can be removed by calculating the spectral
ratio between horizontal and vertical displacement data. In most cases,
however, the tilt direction (measured on a compass - as opposed to tilt
angle, measured from the vertical axis) is unknown and must be determined
from the coherence between rotated horizontal components and the vertical
component. This analysis therefore requires vertical (``?HZ``) and the two
horizontal (``?H1,2``) component data.

**Compliance + Tilt**

It is of course possible to combine both corrections and apply them
sequentially. In this case the tilt noise is removed first, followed by compliance.
This analysis requires all four components: three-component
seismic (``?HZ,1,2``) and pressure (``?DH``) data.

Base Classes
++++++++++++

:mod:`~obstools.atacr` defines the following base classes:

- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.DayNoise`
- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.StaNoise`
- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.TFNoise`
- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.EventStream`

The class :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.DayNoise` contains attributes
and methods for the analysis of two- to four-component day-long time-series
(3-component seismograms and pressure data). Objects created with this class
are required in any subsequent analysis. The available methods calculate the
power-spectral density (PSD) functions of sub-windows (default is 2-hour windows) 
and identifies windows with anomalous PSD properties. These windows are flagged 
and are excluded from the final averages of all possible PSD and cross-spectral density
functions between all available components.

The class :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.StaNoise` contains attributes
and methods for the aggregation of averaged daily spectra into a station
average. An object created with this class requires that at least two
`DayNoise` objects are available in memory. Methods available for this class are
similar to those defined in the `DayNoise` class, but are applied to daily 
spectral averages, as opposed to sub-daily averages. The result is a spectral
average that represents all available data for the specific station.  

The class :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.TFNoise` contains attributes
and methods for the calculation of transfer functions from noise
traces used to correct the vertical component. A `TFNoise` object works with 
either one of `DayNoise` and `StaNoise` objects to calculate all possible
transfer functions across all available components. These transfer functions
are saved as attributes of the object in a Dictionary. 

The class :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.EventStream` contains attributes
and methods for the application of the transfer functions to the
event traces for the correction (cleaning) of vertical component
seismograms. An `EventStream` object is initialized with raw (or pre-processed)
seismic and/or pressure data and needs to be processed using the same (sub) window 
properties as the `DayNoise` objects. This ensures that the component corrections
are safely applied to produce corrected (cleaned) vertical components. 

:mod:`~obstools.atacr` further defines the following container classes:

- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.Power`
- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.Cross`
- :class:`~obstools.atacr.classes.Rotation`

These classes are used as containers for individual traces/objects
that are used as attributes of the base classes. 

.. note::

    In the examples below, the SAC data were obtained and pre-processed
    using the accompanying scripts ``atacr_download_data`` and 
    ``atacr_download_event``. See the script and tutorial for details.

Scripts
*******

There are several Python scripts that accompany ``~obstools.atacr``. These can be used
in bash scripts to automate data processing. These include scripts to download noise and
event data, and perform tilt and compliance noise removal using either the default
program values or by refining parameters. All of them use a station database provided as a
``StDb`` dictionary. These scripts are:

- atacr_download_data

- atacr_download_event

- atacr_daily_spectra

- atacr_clean_spectra

- atacr_transfer_functions

- atacr_correct_event

``atacr_download_data``

``atacr_download_event``
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Description
-----------

Downloads up to four-component (H1, H2, Z and P), two-hour-long seismograms 
for individual seismic events to use in noise corrections of vertical
component data. Station selection is specified by a network and 
station code. The database is provided as a ``StDb`` dictionary.

Usage
-----

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_download_event -h
    usage: atacr_download_event [options] <indb>

    Script used to download and pre-process four-component (H1, H2, Z and P), two-
    hour-long seismograms for individual events on which to apply the de-noising
    algorithms. Data are requested from the internet using the client services
    framework for a given date range. The stations are processed one by one and
    the data are stored to disk.

    positional arguments:
      indb                  Station Database to process from.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --keys STKEYS         Specify a comma separated list of station keys for
                            which to perform the analysis. These must be contained
                            within the station database. Partial keys will be used
                            to match against those in the dictionary. For
                            instance, providing IU will match with all stations in
                            the IU network [Default processes all stations in the
                            database]

                            pressure channel). Specifying '12' allows for tilt
                            correction. Specifying 'P' allows for compliance
                            correction. [Default looks for both horizontal and
                            pressure and allows for both tilt AND compliance

``atacr_correct_event``
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Description
-----------

Loads the transfer functions previously calculated and performs the noise corrections, for either
a single day (from ``atacr_daily_spectra``) or for those averaged over several days
(from ``atacr_clean_spectra``), if available. The database is provided as a 
``StDb`` dictionary.

Usage
-----

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_correct_event -h
    usage: atacr_correct_event [options] <indb>

    Script used to extract transfer functions between various components, and use
    them to clean vertical component of OBS data for selected events. The noise
    data can be those obtained from the daily spectra (i.e., from
    `obs_daily_spectra.py`) or those obtained from the averaged noise spectra
    (i.e., from `obs_clean_spectra.py`). Flags are available to specify the source
    of data to use as well as the time range for given events. The stations are
    processed one by one and the data are stored to disk in a new 'CORRECTED'
    folder.

    positional arguments:

                       perform the analysis. These must be contained within the
                       station database. Partial keys will be used to match
                       against those in the dictionary. For instance, providing IU
                       will match with all stations in the IU network. [Default
                       processes all stations in the database]
      -O, --overwrite  Force the overwriting of pre-existing data. [Default False]

Tutorial
********

.. note::

    Here we roughly follow the steps highlighted in the 
    `Matlab tutorial  <https://github.com/helenjanisz/ATaCR/blob/master/ATaCR_Manual.pdf>`_ 
    for this code and reproduce 
    the various figures. The examples provided below are for one month of data
    (March 2012) recorded at station M08A of the Cascadia Initiative Experiment.
    Corrections are applied to a magnitude 6.6 earthquake that occurred near
    Vanuatu on March 9, 2012.

0. Creating the ``StDb`` Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All the scripts provided require a ``StDb`` database containing station
information and metadata. Let's first create this database for station
M08A and send the prompt to a logfile

.. code-block::

   $ query_fdsn_stdb -N 7D -C ?H? -S M08A M08A > logfile

.. note::

    If you are using a *Z shell* (as opposed to a *Bourne Shell* or 
    other types of shells) on the terminal,
    this command above will fail due to the presence of the question marks for 
    pattern matching. To find out, just type `ps -p $$`, which will return
    `zsh` under the `CMD` field if you are using a Z shell. In this case, just
    enclose the `?H?` in single or double quotes (e.g., 
    `query_fdsn_stdb.py -N 7D -C "?H?" -S M08A M08A > logfile`) 

To check the station info for M08A, use the program ``ls_stdb``:

.. code-block::

   $ ls_stdb M08A.pkl
    Listing Station Pickle: M08A.pkl
    7D.M08A
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1) 7D.M08A
         Station: 7D M08A 
          Alternate Networks: None
          Channel: BH ;  Location: --
          Lon, Lat, Elev:  44.11870, -124.89530,  -0.126
          StartTime: 2011-10-20 00:00:00
          EndTime:   2012-07-18 23:59:59
          Status:    open
          Polarity: 1
          Azimuth Correction: 0.000000

1. Download noise data
++++++++++++++++++++++

We wish to download one month of data for the station M08A for March 2012. 
The various options above allow us to select the additional channels to use
(e.g., ``-C 12,P`` for both horizontal and pressure data - which is the default
setting). Default frequency settings for data pre-processing match those of
the Matlab ``ATaCR`` software and can therefore be ignored when calling the program.
Since the file ``M08A.pkl`` contains only one station, it is not necessary to specify a
key. This option would be useful if the database contained several stations
and we were only interested in downloading data for M08A. In this case, we would
specify ``--keys=M08A`` or ``--keys=7D.M08A``. 
The only required options at this point are the ``--start`` and ``--end`` options
to specify the dates for which data will be downloaded.

If you change your mind about the pre-processing options, you can always re-run the
following line with the option ``-O``, which will overwrite the data saved to disk.

To download all broadband seismic and pressure data, simply type in a terminal:

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_download_data --start=2012-03-01 --end=2012-04-01 M08A.pkl

An example log printed on the terminal will look like:

.. code-block::

    Path to DATA/7D.M08A/ doesn`t exist - creating it

    |===============================================|

    ...

And so on until all day-long files have been downloaded. You will
notice that a folder called ``DATA/7D.M08A/`` has been created.
This is where all day-long files will be stored on disk. 

2. QC for daily spectral averages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For this step, there are several Parameter Settings that can be tuned. Once again,
the default values are the ones used to reproduce the results of the Matlab
ATaCR software and can be left un-changed. The Time Search Settings can be used
to look at a subset of the available day-long data files. Here these options 
can be ignored since we wish to look at all the availble data that we just downloaded. 
We can therefore type in a terminal:

.. code-block:: 

    $ atacr_daily_spectra M08A.pkl

    Path to SPECTRA/7D.M08A/ doesn`t exist - creating it

    |===============================================|
    |===============================================|
    |                       M08A                    |

    |===============================================|
    |  Station: 7D.M08A                             |

    |      Lon: -124.90; Lat:  44.12                |
    |      Start time: 2011-10-20 00:00:00          |

    *   16 good windows. Proceeding...

    ...

And so on until all available data have been processed. The software stores the
``obstools.atacr.classes.DayNoise`` objects to a newly
created folder called ``SPECTRA/7D.M08A/``. To produce figures for visualization,
we can re-run the above script but now use the plotting options to look
at one day of the month (March 04, 2012). In this case we need to overwrite the 
previous results (option ``-O``) and specify the date of interest:

.. code-block:: 

    $ atacr_daily_spectra -O --figQC --figAverage --start=2012-03-04 --end=2012-03-05 M08A.pkl > logfile

The script will produce several figures, including Figures 2 and 3 (separated 
into 3a and 3b below). Several intermediate steps are also produces, which show
all the raw data and the window classification into good and bad windows for 
subsequent analysis.

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_2.png
   :align: center

Figure 2: Daily spectrogram for the vertical (Z), horizontals (H1, H2), and pressure
(P) components.

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_3a.png
   :align: center

nents from a single day of data (M08A, March 4, 2012, same as in Figure 2). The left
column shows PSDs for each individual window; PSDs from windows that did not
pass the quality control are colored red.

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_3b.png
   :align: center

Figure 3b: Daily average PSD of bad (red) and good (black) windows.

3. QC for clean station averages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that we have processed daily spectra for all available components, it is
possible to further average the spectra over multiple days to produce a cleaned
station average. It is still possible to specify a date range over which to 
average the spectra, thus giving flexibility in the production of the station
averages. Parameter settings are similar to those used in ``atacr_daily_spectra``
but further include the option of plotting the averaged cross-spectral properties.
To calculate a single station average for the entire month of March 2012 (and 
therefore using all available data) and plot the results, we can type in a terminal:

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_clean_spectra --figQC --figAverage --figCoh --figCross M08A.pkl

    Path to AVG_STA/7D.M08A/ doesn`t exist - creating it

    |===============================================|
    |===============================================|
    |                       M08A                    |

    |===============================================|
    |  Station: 7D.M08A                             |

    |      Lon: -124.90; Lat:  44.12                |
    |      Start time: 2011-10-20 00:00:00          |
    |      End time:   2012-07-18 23:59:59          |

    ...

And so on until all ``DayNoise`` objects are averaged into a ``StaNoise`` 
object, which is saved to a newly created folder called ``AVG_STA/7D.M08A/``.

.. note ::

    If you don't specify the options ``--start`` and ``--end``, the object
    will be saved with a filename that corresponds to the entire deployment time
    of the station, but in fact the object contains the average spectra of all 
    daily spectra available on disk, and *not necessarily* the average over the 
    entire deployment time. We recommend using the ``--start`` and ``--end`` options
    if you want to produce time-limited spectral averages (e.g., an average per week
    or per month, etc.). For example:

    .. code-block::

        $ atacr_clean_spectra --start=2012-03-01 --end=2012-03-08 -O M08A.pkl

Several figures are also produced, including Figures 4, 6-9.

Figure 4: The orientation of maximum coherence between the vertical and the two
horizontal components for M08A during March 2012. (Left) Coherence as a function
of angle from the H1 component. (Right) Phase as a function of the angle. In this
example, the coherence is low indicating the absence of dominant, uni-directional tilt
noise.

Figure 7: The daily coherences between pairs of components as indicated above each
subplot for March 2012 at station M08A (e.g. 1Z - coherence between Horizontal 1
and Vertical). Each line represents average coherence for a single day in the data
set. Gray colors indicate days that were accepted by the second quality control step,
while the red colors indicate days that were discarded. Note that some definitions
are different (e.g., ``ZP`` vs ``PZ``) than those used in the Matlab Tutorial.

while the red colors indicate days that were discarded. Note that some definitions
are different (e.g., ``ZP`` vs ``PZ``) than those used in the Matlab Tutorial.

4. Transfer function calculation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once the ``StaNoise`` objects have been produced and saved to disk, the transfer 
functions across all available components can be calculated. By default the software
will calculate the ones for which the spectral averages are available. 

For compliance only (i.e., only ``?HZ`` and ``?DH?`` components are available),
the only transfer function possible is:

- ``ZP``

For tilt only (i.e., all of ``?HZ,1,2`` components are available, but not ``?DH``), 
the transfer functions are:

- ``Z1``

- ``Z2-1``

For both tilt and compliance (i.e., all four components are available), the 
following transfer functions are possible:

- ``Z1``

- ``Z2-1``

- ``ZP``

- ``ZP-21``

If you are using a ``DayNoise`` object to calculate the transfer functions,
the following may also be possible (if all components are available):

- ``ZH``

- ``ZP-H``

In this example we calculate all available transfer functions for all available data.
In this case we do not need to specify any option and type in a terminal:

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_transfer_functions M08A.pkl

Note how the ``DayNoise`` objects are read randomly from disk, followed by the 
``StaNoise`` object. The result is a ``TFNoise`` object that is saved to a newly
created folder called ``TF_STA/7D.M08A/``. 

We can produce Figure 10 by re-running the previous command with the options
``-O --figTF``.

for station M08A. The daily transfer functions are shown in grey and the average
calculated for the whole month is shown in black.

5. Download earthquake data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now we need to download the earthquake data, for which we wish to 
clean the vertical component using the transfer functions just calculated. 
This script ``atacr_download_event`` is very similar to ``atacr_download_data``, 
with the addition of the Event and Geometry Settings. 

.. warning::

    Be careful with the Frequency Settings, as these values need to be exactly
    the same as those used in ``atacr_download_data``, but won't be checked
    against. 

To download the seismograms that recorded the March 9, 2012, magnitude 6.6 
Vanuatu earthquake (be conservative with the options), type in a terminal:

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_download_event --min-mag=6.3 --max-mag=6.7 --start=2012-03-08 --end=2012-03-10 M08A.pkl

The data are stored as an ``EventStream`` object, saved to disk in the
newly created folder ``EVENTS/7D.M08A/``. 

6. Correct/clean earthquake data
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The final step in the analysis is the application of the transfer functions
to the raw earthquake seismograms to clean up the vertical component. 
Once again, the default settings can be used. The corrected seismograms will
be saved to disk in a new folder called ``EVENTS/7D.M08A/CORRECTED``. To make 
the final Figures 11 and 12, specify the ``--figRaw`` and ``--figClean`` options:

.. code-block::

    $ atacr_correct_event --figRaw --figClean M08A.pkl

    TF_STA/7D.M08A/2012.069.transfunc.pkl file found - applying transfer functions

Results are saved both as updated ``EventStream`` objects and as ``.SAC`` files that 
now contain the corrected vertical components. 

.. note::

    The ``EventStream`` object contains the corrected traces in the attribute 
    ``correct``, which is a dictionary. If you wish to extract the corrected 
    vertical seismogram obtained from the ``ZP`` transfer function, with a corresponding
    key ``'ZP'``, you can do this by loading the ``.pkl`` file and typing: 

    .. code-block::

        >>> # First load the EventStream object
        >>> import pickle as pkl
        >>> evstream = pkl.load(open('2012.069.transfunc.pkl', 'rb'))
        >>> # Extract the 'ZP' corrected seismogram
        >>> corrected = evstream.correct['ZP']
    
    You can check which transfer functions should be available based on the number of
    components in the ``EventStream`` object from the attribute:

    .. code-block::

        >>> print(evstream.ev_list)

    Note that the corrected seismogram will only be available if the corresponding 
    transfer function has been calculated previously and applied during the correction. 

Figures 11 and 12 should look like:

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_11.png
   :align: center

Figure 11: Event time series for the vertical (Z), horizontal 1 (H1), horizontal 2 (H2),
and pressure (P) components. No corrections have been applied. The data is for
station M08A for the Mw 6.6 earthquake that occurred near Vanuatu on March 9,
2012 and has been bandpass filtered from 10 - 150 s.

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_12a.png
   :align: center

Figure 12a: Event time series for the vertical (Z) components after each of the transfer
functions of interest have been applied. The corrections are specified in the titles of
each subplot. The data is for station M08A for the Mw 6.6 earthquake that occurred
near Vanuatu on March 9, 2012 (same as Figure 11) and has been bandpass filtered
from 10 - 150 s. Traces in grey show the original (raw, un-corrected) vertical component.

.. figure:: ../obstools/examples/figures/Figure_12b.png
   :align: center

Figure 12b: Same as Figure 12a but using the station averaged transfer functions. In this 
case the ``ZH`` and ``ZP-H`` transfer functions are not available.
