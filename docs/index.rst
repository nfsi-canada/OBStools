Documentation
=============

OBStools is a package containing Python tools for processing broadband
ocean-bottom seismic (OBS) data. Current functionalities include removing
vertical component noise from tilt and compliance effects, calculating tilt orientation from three-component seismic data, and calculating compliance functions from vertical displacement and pressure data. The code uses 
the ``StDb`` package for querying and building a station database and
can be used through command-line scripts.
